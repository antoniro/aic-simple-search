# AIC Simple Search

This is a basic react app that allows the user to search for artists and their artworks using the API provided by the Art Institute of Chicago API.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run the app

Follow these steps to run the application:
- Clone the repo to your local machine.
- navigate to the root folder of the cloned repo and execute the command `yarn install` or `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- Run the application by executing the command `yarn start` or `npm start`.
  
  This should open a new page in your preferred browser. You can also manually open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in any browser.
